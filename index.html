             <h1>electron + node-powershell: scripting workflows using recursive tail calls</h1>
             <p class="right">If you're wondering "What the heck is using electron with node powershell all about?" check out <a href="https://xainey.github.io/2017/powershell-electron-demo/">this great article.</a></p>

           <p>I run into this scenario constantly: I'm automating a task.  I want to, for example, get all the AD Users in an OU, and filter, and map a function that performs a task for each user in my dataset.  While its not always that simple its usually fairly procedural steps: A, B, C</p>

        <div class="row">When I first created this demo I was, in fact, using good old Map.  To execute my powershell script x 10 users I would map a set of 10 names against my node-powershell function and this would spawn 10 powershell processes on the first click.  Twenty after a second click... and so on.  I put it on github as a cautionary example and because I thought it was funny.  Later on it came up pretty much any time I used node-powershell especially when pairing it with electron to create a cool user interface.</div>

        <div class="row">The principle is related to the way we write powershell.  We say things like for each child object of this folder, copy the file to network storage.  Or we say split this string by a delimiter character and for each substring call a certain cmdlet.  If your powershell scripts are simple then you need to orchestrate them in a sophisticated way to actually <b>do</b> anything.  The reason why all the Map, Filter, Reducing couldn't happen inside the PowerShell scripts is because it brings the application state into the UI.  You can observe and interact with the powershell tasks and issue new commands asynchronously.  This is the thing that makes ezpz electron apps worth including in your just-get-it-done powershell world.  Its an easy button for a rich user experience in a world where automation is dead easy and user interfaces are hard.  I use electron and materialize and redux</div>
